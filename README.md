input values, output job summary
I was trying to write a function that printed out an array of strings plus
	the int values from the form. I was trying to get it to output into the paragraph below,
	but I couldn't get that to work. So I went with the document write function to output 
	on a new page. At first I couldn't get it to display the string and int on the same line,
	so I wrote the outputs in two separate functions and it started working. 
  
Added better styling, line spacing for output, and cleaned up code

got rid of input array and used concatenation
