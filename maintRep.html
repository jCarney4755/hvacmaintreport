<!--
	I was trying to write a function that printed out an array of strings plus
	the int values from the form. I was trying to get it to output into the paragraph below,
	but I couldn't get that to work. So I went with the document write function to output 
	on a new page. At first I couldn't get it to display the string and int on the same line,
	so I wrote the outputs in two separate functions and it started working. 

	Later I got rid of the document write and started using innerHTML.

	Another issue I had was getting it to pull the int value from the form and assign it to 
	the variables I declared, but then I realized I assigned the ID to the label instead of 
	the input.

<script>
	let low, high, ampsin, returntemp, supplytemp, ampsout;
	
	function mreport() {

		ampsin = document.getElementById("ampsin").value;
		returntemp = document.getElementById("returntemp").value;
		supplytemp = document.getElementById("supplytemp").value;
		var tempsplit = (returntemp - supplytemp);
		low = document.getElementById("low").value;
		high = document.getElementById("high").value;
		ampsout = document.getElementById("ampsout").value;

		//backticks allow string interpolation for better looking array

		const amparr = [`Indoor amps are ${ampsin} amp(s). `];
		const rtemparr = [`Return temp is ${returntemp}. `];
		const stemparr = [`supply temp is ${supplytemp}. `];
		const tempsparr = [`The temp split is ${tempsplit}. `];
		const lowarr = [`Low side pressure is ${low}. `];
		const hiarr = [`High side pressure is ${high}. `];
		const outamps = [`Outdoor amps are ${ampsout}. `];
		

		// can't figure out how to add line spacing. \n breaks code.

		const marray = [amparr, rtemparr, stemparr, tempsparr, lowarr, hiarr, outamps];

		/*
		getting two commas in output. 
		might try array within array to interpolate string and var
		(issue resolved after using backticks)
		*/

		 // the user input displays the way I intend if I put all of it as an array

		document.getElementById("repdiv").innerHTML= marray;
